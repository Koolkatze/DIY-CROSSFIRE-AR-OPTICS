AR OPTICS CAN BE MADE AT HOME CHEAP AND EASY. I WILL USE THE HIGHEST F.O.V. AND DOUBLE MICRODISPLAY FOR THIS ONE.

The "LENS" is nothing but a transparent christmas ball cut with a mini rotative electric saw.
The "MIRROR" is nothing but any plane shiny transparent plastic or a semi-translucent mirror.
I'm looking for a microdisplay to give you the link. WIP for now.


ROADMAP:

1. FIND A HIGH RESOLUTION MICRODISPLAY THAT FITS THE DESIGN.
2. CREATE A 3D PRINTABLE MODEL OF THE CASE FOR THE OPTICS (TO PLACE THE DISPLAY, LENS AND MIRROR IN IT AND HIDE ANY CABLE).
3. CREATE A 3D GLASSES FRAME MODEL FOR THE OPTICS TO SIT ON YOUR FACE.
4. WE WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF THEY WILL BE STANDALONE OR TETHERED AND TREAT THE SOFTWARE AS WE NEED.
5. CREATE AN EXTERNAL SOLUTION FOR BATTERY CAPACITY, TO TRY AND EXTEND BATTERY DURING LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHILE IN USE.
6. CREATE DIFFERENT DESIGNS FOR FASHIONABLE AR GLASSES.
