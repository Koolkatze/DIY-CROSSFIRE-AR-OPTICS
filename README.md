AR Optics can be made at home cheap and easy. I will use the highest F.O.V. you will be able to find in any place, no glasses use this fov for now, and DOUBLE MICRODISPLAY for this one.

List of products to build the project:

• The "LENS" is nothing but a transparent 6,50cm diameter christmas ball cut to 4,50cm diameter circle with a mini rotative electric saw or could also be same size transparent glass bulb cut with an electrically heated metal wire and placed under cold water to break evenly.

• The "MIRROR" is nothing but any plane shiny transparent plastic or a semi-translucent mirrortat covers from the top of the display from the top to the bottom of the display from the bottom.

• The microdisplay is this one: 
 
Pantalla AMOLED DO0200FS01, 1,91 pulgadas, 240x536, SPI, QSPI, I8080, STM32, ESP32, código LVGL, módulo LCD esquemático de circuito

or any microdisplay with 4cm x 2cm screen size aproximately.

Over the optics (at the left side of the schematic) you can place any kind of sunglass lens or fotochromatic lens (this is not specified yet but I will make the glasses frames compatible with other generic glasses to make it universally customizable).

ROADMAP:

1. FIND A HIGH RESOLUTION MICRODISPLAY THAT FITS THE DESIGN.
2. CREATE A 3D PRINTABLE MODEL OF THE CASE FOR THE OPTICS (TO PLACE THE DISPLAY, LENS AND MIRROR IN IT AND HIDE ANY CABLE).
3. CREATE A 3D GLASSES FRAME MODEL FOR THE OPTICS TO SIT ON YOUR FACE.
4. WE WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF THEY WILL BE STANDALONE OR TETHERED AND TREAT THE SOFTWARE AS WE NEED.
5. CREATE AN EXTERNAL SOLUTION FOR BATTERY CAPACITY, TO TRY AND EXTEND BATTERY DURING LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHILE IN USE.
6. CREATE DIFFERENT DESIGNS FOR FASHIONABLE AR GLASSES.
