AR Optics can be made at home cheap and easy. 

I will use the highest F.O.V. you will be able to find in any place, no glasses use this fov for now, and DOUBLE MICRODISPLAY ON EACH EYE for this one.

DISCLAMER: The scale or size of the piezes can be modified with an even ratio, maybe the size of the display can vary for that same reason. I am still trying to figure out the best way to make the optics and its still not fisically mounted.

Experiment under your own financial risk.

List of products to build the project:

• The "LENS" is nothing but a transparent 6cm, 8cm, or 9cm diameter christmas ball (the focal point of the sphere is allways at its center so depending in which distance you would like to wear the glasses from the lens to the eyes you will want to choose one of them all, the best diameter afterall could be 9cm, remember: the lens will always need to be stuck ti the left limit of the diagram, that way you won't change the distance and angle of reflection, if you moved the lens to the right of the diagram for what ever reason you would overlap the images of the display) afterwards cut to 4,50cm diameter circle with a mini rotative electric saw or could also be same size transparent glass bulb cut with an electrically or gas heated metal wire and placed under cold water to break evenly as in the following video:

This is the type of christmas ball: https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005007494654928.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.11.74d5GHj1GHj1ru&algo_pvid=94ba693f-28a0-4506-ac77-2f596d9118a6&algo_exp_id=94ba693f-28a0-4506-ac77-2f596d9118a6-10&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%2227%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%2C%22fromPage%22%3A%22search%22%7D&pdp_npi=6%40dis%21EUR%211.59%211.59%21%21%211.83%211.83%21%4021038e6617719419688692848e3321%2112000044592659945%21sea%21ES%213907980870%21X%211%210%21n_tag%3A-29919%3Bd%3Af6debfdc%3Bm03_new_user%3A-29895&curPageLogUid=5AtHR3SCXgeY&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A%7Cx_object_id%3A1005007494654928%7C_p_origin_prod%3A

If you find a bulb with the same diameter, tell me, I want to add the option here.

You will need to cut the upper an bottom part of the 4,50cm circle, the measure between top and bottom is 2,5cm

It could be necessary to use some kind of glue, it's be best to use double grip tape to stick it to the holder.

• SUNGLASS OPTICS PROTECTOR AND EXTERNAL LIGHT DIMMER:

You will need to cut the lens to a WIDTH: 3,4cm, HEIGHT: 1,4cm.

It could be necessary to use some kind of glue, it's be best to use double grip tape to stick it to the holder.

• The "MIRROR" is nothing but any plane shiny transparent plastic or a semi-translucent mirror that covers from the top of the display from the top to the bottom of the display from the bottom.

• The microdisplay is this one:

• The "OPTICS HOLDER", a 3D Printed model that holds the optics when you press the holder inside the frames of the glasses.

• The "FRAME" is a 3D printable model able to hold the optics holder and the optics stuck by applying pressure.

• The "TEMPLES" are 3D printed and hold th electronics of the project, for now it's a work in progress.


ROADMAP:

1. FIND A HIGH RESOLUTION MICRODISPLAY THAT FITS THE DESIGN. ✅ done (FOUND THE BEST RESOLUTION).
   
2. CREATE A 3D PRINTABLE MODEL OF THE CASE FOR THE OPTICS (TO PLACE THE DISPLAY, LENS AND MIRROR IN IT AND HIDE ANY CABLE). ✅ done

3. CREATE A 3D GLASSES FRAME MODEL FOR THE OPTICS TO SIT ON YOUR FACE. ✅ done

4. CREATE A 3D MODEL FOR THE TEMPLES THAT HOLDS THE ELECTRONICS FOR THE DISPLAYS TO WORK.

5. WE WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF THEY WILL BE STANDALONE OR TETHERED AND TREAT THE SOFTWARE AS WE NEED.
6. CREATE AN EXTERNAL SOLUTION FOR BATTERY CAPACITY, TO TRY AND EXTEND BATTERY DURING LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHILE IN USE.
7. CREATE DIFFERENT DESIGNS FOR FASHIONABLE AR GLASSES.
