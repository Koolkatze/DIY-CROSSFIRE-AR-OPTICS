AR Optics can be made at home cheap and easy. I will use the highest F.O.V. you will be able to find in any place, no glasses use this fov for now, and DOUBLE MICRODISPLAY for this one.

DISCLAMER: The scale or size of the piezes can be modified with an even ratio, maybe the size of the display can vary for that same reason. I am still trying to figure out the best way to make the optics and its still not fisically mounted.

Experiment under your own financial risk.

List of products to build the project:

• The "LENS" is nothing but a transparent 6cm, 8cm, or 9cm diameter christmas ball (the focal point of the sphere is allways at its center so depending in which distance you would like to wear the glasses from the lens to the eyes you will want to choose one of them all, remember: the lens will always need to be stuck ti the left limit of the diagram, that way you won't change the distance and angle of reflection, if you moved the lens to the right of the diagram for what ever reason you would overlap the images of the display) afterwards cut to 4,50cm diameter circle with a mini rotative electric saw or could also be same size transparent glass bulb cut with an electrically heated metal wire and placed under cold water to break evenly.

• The "MIRROR" is nothing but any plane shiny transparent plastic or a semi-translucent mirror that covers from the top of the display from the top to the bottom of the display from the bottom.

• The microdisplay is this one: 
 
AMOLED DO0200FS01, 1,91 inches, 240x536, SPI, QSPI, I8080, STM32, ESP32,LVGL code, LCD module: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EvtKkqk

or any microdisplay with 4cm x 2cm screen size aproximately.

Over the optics (at the left side of the schematic) you can place any kind of sunglass lens or fotochromatic lens (this is not specified yet but I will make the glasses frames compatible with other generic glasses to make it universally customizable).

ROADMAP:

1. FIND A HIGH RESOLUTION MICRODISPLAY THAT FITS THE DESIGN. ✅ done (the resolution could be better but I still believe in finding a better one in the future).
   
2. CREATE A 3D PRINTABLE MODEL OF THE CASE FOR THE OPTICS (TO PLACE THE DISPLAY, LENS AND MIRROR IN IT AND HIDE ANY CABLE).
3. CREATE A 3D GLASSES FRAME MODEL FOR THE OPTICS TO SIT ON YOUR FACE.
4. WE WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF THEY WILL BE STANDALONE OR TETHERED AND TREAT THE SOFTWARE AS WE NEED.
5. CREATE AN EXTERNAL SOLUTION FOR BATTERY CAPACITY, TO TRY AND EXTEND BATTERY DURING LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHILE IN USE.
6. CREATE DIFFERENT DESIGNS FOR FASHIONABLE AR GLASSES.
